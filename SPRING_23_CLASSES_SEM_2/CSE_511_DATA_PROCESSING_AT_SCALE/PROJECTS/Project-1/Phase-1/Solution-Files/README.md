## Run Project


To run this project locally, you need to run

```
docker run -it <Docker Image Name / Id>
```
- Once in the command prompt, to test the project, we have included a script file, automationTest.sh, which takes in a parameter 
```
    1 - rangequery
    2 - rangejoinquery
    3 - distancequery
    4 - distancejoinquery
    5 - All

    Example command to run rangequery would be
    sh automationTest.sh 1
```
- The script will take care of everything:
    - It will delete the current jar file if present.
    - It will delete any target folders present
    - It will then execute spark-submit job, depending on the parameter passed.
    - Then it will verify results with expected and current outputs.
    - Note this script will work only for test case which was provided in the problem description.

# We also have completed Bonus Assignment.

To run it, you can download the latest image or specific version of Image using following command.

```
    docker pull cnjarami/group10-project1-phase1-bonus:<Version Number>

Example Command:
    docker pull cnjarami/group10-project1-phase1-bonus:v0
    cd /root/cse511
```
You will find JAR file here, either you can run 

```
spark-submit CSE511-assembly-0.1.0.jar "result/output" "rangequery" "/root/cse511/src/resources/arealm10000.csv" "-93.63173,33.0183,-93.359203,33.219456" "rangejoinquery" "/root/cse511/src/resources/arealm10000.csv" "/root/cse511/src/resources/zcta10000.csv" "distancequery" "/root/cse511/src/resources/arealm10000.csv" "-88.331492,32.324142" "1" "distancejoinquery" "/root/cse511/src/resources/arealm10000.csv" "/root/cse511/src/resources/arealm10000.csv" "0.1"
```
Or, proceed with your testing part directly with code in the folder.
