        "content": "I wrote an article about Barbie after an interview with psychiatrist/cultural\ntheorist Dr. Jeanne Randolph for the #MedicalPost/#CanadianHealthcare Network.\nIt's free for #doctors, #pharmacists in #Canada. But here are few salient\nparagraphs.\n\n\"Dr. Randolph is both a #psychiatrist and a cultural theorist who uses a\npsychoanalytic lens when looking at icons such as Barbie. Studying #Barbie\nprovokes questions about toys' contribution to the #health and ethics in\n#kids.\n\nIndeed, back in the 1990s, she wrote a chapter for a book, Consuming Fashions:\nAdorning the Trans-National Body, that included details of a small study she\nconducted investigating how girls treated their Barbie dolls. The book itself\nincluded historical psychological and anthropological aspects of fashion.\n\nWhat she found in wasn’t pretty.\n\nIndeed, it was common for girls to cut off Barbie’s hair, paint them, poke or\nburn holes in them, twist their head around backwards, remove limbs, or even\nswap their head with other dolls.\n\nBut, she told the Medical Post, it's healthy for young kids to express\naggressive or sadistic behaviours through their toys. It helps them cope with,\nand understand, their aggression in the long run—better than keeping it all\nbottled up and having it expressed in something real.\n\nOne moment, Barbie is a super model, an ideal parent or a brilliant astronaut,\nthe next she might be beating up other toys, joining a biker gang, or holding\nup banks. Young kids learn about themselves and the world around them through\nplay, she said.\n\nFor a long time, Barbie was marketed with an image of femininity that was\ndevoid of aggression.\n\nBarbie represented a huge cultural shift when she was first introduced in\n1959. Prior to that, girls were given dolls that looked like babies, making\ntheir play limited to that as moms or caregivers—a fact the new movie points\nout.\n\nBarbie was the first adult doll girls could identify with, Dr. Randolph said.\nThey could expand the roles they played—except she was presented an\nexaggerated version of some idealized female form with her tall, slender\nproportions.\n\n“In a way, Barbie was asking for it. It’s like the Barbie doll is so perfect,\nso unrealistic that she incited children to resent her or to be anxious\nbecause she’s not real,” she said. Hence some of the destructive behaviour.\n\nYet doing things like removing a Barbie’s head doesn’t mean a child will grow\nup a sociopath. Often, it’s just because the heads are easy to remove, and\nmore of an exploration of how things work.\n\nWhen she wrote about Barbie for that book chapter in the 1990s, Dr. Randolph\nwanted to include a picture of the doll. She looked for an advertising image\nthat showed some aggression in Barbie, but the best she could find was an\nimage of a fishing Barbie holding a large, plastic dead fish. The fish had a\nsmile on it.\n\nShe wrote the toy company that produced Barbie for permission to use the\nimage.\n\n“I got a letter back from Mattel’s lawyers. They had read my chapter all about\nsadism and about how Barbie is asking for it, the doll is too perfect. They\nsaid I should seek legal council. They said they entirely rejected the\nnegativity of this chapter and that Barbie is a valuable product which they\ndid not want to be seen in this light,” she said.\n\nThere was always a disconnect between how Barbie was marketed and how little\ngirls played with her.\n\nThe chapter was published, and the letter from Mattel was included in its\nentirety in a footnote.\n\nHowever, the new Barbie movie showed a turnabout in recognition of the\ndichotomy Barbie represents. It acknowledged the imaginary, perfect world\nBarbie comes from, the cultural impact of Barbie dolls, that in real-life\nBarbies are mistreated, that many kids have cynical attitudes about Barbie,\nand also that some people love her.\n\n“The movie is exactly what you would hope for in terms of the image and the\nhumanity of women,” she said. The #feminist messages are strong, with powerful\nsatirical punch towards #patriarchy.\"\n\nFor those with accounts, the story can be accessed here.  \n#medmastodon @medmastodon #psychiatry\n\ndolls\n\n",
