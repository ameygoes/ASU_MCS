        "content": "I wrote an article about Barbie after an interview with psychiatrist/cultural\ntheorist Dr. Jeanne Randolph for the #MedicalPost/#CanadianHealthcare Network.\nIt's free for #doctors, #pharmacists in #Canada. But here are few salient\nparagraphs.\n\n\"Dr. Randolph is both a #psychiatrist and a cultural theorist who uses a\npsychoanalytic lens when looking at icons such as Barbie. Studying #Barbie\nprovokes questions about toys' contribution to the #health and ethics in\n#kids.\n\nIndeed, back in the 1990s, she wrote a chapter for a book, Consuming Fashions:\nAdorning the Trans-National Body, that included details of a small study she\nconducted investigating how girls treated their Barbie dolls. The book itself\nincluded historical psychological and anthropological aspects of fashion.\n\nWhat she found in wasn‚Äôt pretty.\n\nIndeed, it was common for girls to cut off Barbie‚Äôs hair, paint them, poke or\nburn holes in them, twist their head around backwards, remove limbs, or even\nswap their head with other dolls.\n\nBut, she told the Medical Post, it's healthy for young kids to express\naggressive or sadistic behaviours through their toys. It helps them cope with,\nand understand, their aggression in the long run‚Äîbetter than keeping it all\nbottled up and having it expressed in something real.\n\nOne moment, Barbie is a super model, an ideal parent or a brilliant astronaut,\nthe next she might be beating up other toys, joining a biker gang, or holding\nup banks. Young kids learn about themselves and the world around them through\nplay, she said.\n\nFor a long time, Barbie was marketed with an image of femininity that was\ndevoid of aggression.\n\nBarbie represented a huge cultural shift when she was first introduced in\n1959. Prior to that, girls were given dolls that looked like babies, making\ntheir play limited to that as moms or caregivers‚Äîa fact the new movie points\nout.\n\nBarbie was the first adult doll girls could identify with, Dr. Randolph said.\nThey could expand the roles they played‚Äîexcept she was presented an\nexaggerated version of some idealized female form with her tall, slender\nproportions.\n\n‚ÄúIn a way, Barbie was asking for it. It‚Äôs like the Barbie doll is so perfect,\nso unrealistic that she incited children to resent her or to be anxious\nbecause she‚Äôs not real,‚Äù she said. Hence some of the destructive behaviour.\n\nYet doing things like removing a Barbie‚Äôs head doesn‚Äôt mean a child will grow\nup a sociopath. Often, it‚Äôs just because the heads are easy to remove, and\nmore of an exploration of how things work.\n\nWhen she wrote about Barbie for that book chapter in the 1990s, Dr. Randolph\nwanted to include a picture of the doll. She looked for an advertising image\nthat showed some aggression in Barbie, but the best she could find was an\nimage of a fishing Barbie holding a large, plastic dead fish. The fish had a\nsmile on it.\n\nShe wrote the toy company that produced Barbie for permission to use the\nimage.\n\n‚ÄúI got a letter back from Mattel‚Äôs lawyers. They had read my chapter all about\nsadism and about how Barbie is asking for it, the doll is too perfect. They\nsaid I should seek legal council. They said they entirely rejected the\nnegativity of this chapter and that Barbie is a valuable product which they\ndid not want to be seen in this light,‚Äù she said.\n\nThere was always a disconnect between how Barbie was marketed and how little\ngirls played with her.\n\nThe chapter was published, and the letter from Mattel was included in its\nentirety in a footnote.\n\nHowever, the new Barbie movie showed a turnabout in recognition of the\ndichotomy Barbie represents. It acknowledged the imaginary, perfect world\nBarbie comes from, the cultural impact of Barbie dolls, that in real-life\nBarbies are mistreated, that many kids have cynical attitudes about Barbie,\nand also that some people love her.\n\n‚ÄúThe movie is exactly what you would hope for in terms of the image and the\nhumanity of women,‚Äù she said. The #feminist messages are strong, with powerful\nsatirical punch towards #patriarchy.\"\n\nFor those with accounts, the story can be accessed here.  \n#medmastodon @medmastodon #psychiatry\n\ndolls\n\n",

        "content": "How #Finland Put #Traffic #Crashes on Ice\n\nThe Nordic nation‚Äôs rate of vehicle fatalities is a fraction of the toll in\nthe #US, despite a harsh climate and ice-covered streets. Here‚Äôs how the Finns\ndo traffic safety.\n\nby David Zipper\n\n\"The 1960s were a boom time for #Helsinki, Finland‚Äôs capital and largest city.\nRising postwar incomes enabled a growing number of residents to purchase a\ncar; the number of vehicles registered in the city tripled in just seven\nyears. #Gridlock inevitably followed.\n\n\"To manage traffic and plot its future, the city of Helsinki commissioned a\ntransportation master plan, co-authored by the US company Wilbur Smith &\nAssociates and the Finnish firm Pentti Polvinen ky. In 1968, the consultants\ndelivered their eye-watering proposal: nearly 200 miles of new highways in the\nHelsinki region, with much of downtown leveled to create space for high-speed\nmotorways. The city‚Äôs existent streetcar system would be scrapped.\n\n\"The Finnish response to that vision was an emphatic ei (‚Äúno‚Äù). According to\nthe newspaper Helsingin Sanomat, the rejected 1968 plan 'has become a kind of\ndystopia, an extreme example of what car-driven planning can lead to.'\n\n\"Instead of committing its future to the automobile, as so many US cities did\nin that era, Helsinki kept its streetcars and embarked on a massive transit\nexpansion. The city constructed the world‚Äôs northernmost subway, which opened\nin 1982. As of 2016, roughly a quarter of urban trips in Finland occur on\nfoot, over 9% by transit, and 7.5% by bike. (In the Helsinki metropolitan\narea, which has a population about 1.3 million, those numbers are even\nhigher.) One in seven Finns live in rural areas, roughly equivalent to the US\nshare.\n\n\"The Finnish transportation system is as impressive for its safety as it is\nfor its multimodality. Only 219 people died on Finnish roads in 2021, or four\nper 100,000 residents ‚Äî just one-third the US rate. And Finland‚Äôs roadways are\ngrowing steadily safer. Fatalities plunged 50% between 2001 and 2019, when\nHelsinki made international news for going an entire year without a single\npedestrian or cyclist fatality. (Last year there were two, down from 22 in\n1990.) Like its neighbors #Norway and #Sweden, birthplace of the #VisionZero\ntraffic safety movement, Finland‚Äôs roads today are safer than they have been\nin decades ‚Äî unlike so many of the US cities that have tried to adopt Vision\nZero principles.\n\n\"As I‚Äôve written previously in CityLab, the US is an outlier in global\n#RoadSafety: Americans are now at least twice as likely to die in a vehicle\ncrash as residents of Canada, France and Japan (among many other countries).\n\n\"But the safety record of Finland, a country associated with empty, rural\nroads and cold, dark weather, is particularly impressive. Here are a few\nreasons why so few people die in crashes in this Nordic nation.\n\n\"Set Stricter Limits\n\n\"Soon after dumping Helsinki‚Äôs car-centric 1968 plan, Finnish authorities\nembarked on a decades-long campaign to slow motor vehicles. 'In urban\nenvironments, there has been a steady decrease in maximum road speed,' said\nHeikki Liimatainen, a professor of transport and logistics at Tampere\nUniversity. 'In the 1970s, it was normally 50 kilometers per hour in cities;\nthen in 2000, it went down to 40 km/h. Now, more than half of our urban\nstreets have a 30 km/h limit.'\n\n\"In Helsinki, city officials leverage street design to reinforce lower speed\nlimits. 'We deliberately have narrow lanes, so the driver doesn‚Äôt feel\ncomfortable,' said Reetta Putkonen, the director of Helsinki‚Äôs transportation\nplanning division. 'Three and a half meters is a normal lane width, even 3.2.\nWe also use trees and bushes to push people to go slower.' For comparison, in\nthe US many lanes are 12 feet (3.7 meters) wide.\"\n\nRead more:  \n\nice?utm_source=pocket-newtab-en-us\n\n#Cycling #Transportation #Cities #Safety #SpeedLimits #UrbanRenewal\n#PublicTransportation\n\n",

But a legislative\nassault aimed at eroding these protections is underway in several state\nlegislatures.\n\n\"It‚Äôs nothing new. Various states have long-tried to curtail the right to\n#protest. They do so by legislating wide definitions of what constitutes an\n'unlawful assembly' or a 'riot' as well as increasing punishments. They also\nallow police to use catch-all public offenses, such as #trespassing,\nobstructing traffic, or disrupting the peace, as a pretext for ordering\ndispersals, using force, and making arrests. Finally, they make it easier for\n#corporations and others to bring lawsuits against #protest organizers.\n\n\"While proportionate restrictions on the right of peaceful assembly, like\ncreating buffer zones around abortion clinics to ensure access, may be\nnecessary, the use of catch-all offenses against peaceful #demonstrators or\nthe imposition of increased penalties to deter assemblies are not.\n\n\"At a time of large mobilizations across the US, attempts by states to deter\nand impose criminal penalties on peaceful protesters should be stopped.\n\n\"According to the US Protest Law Tracker, created by the International Center\nfor Not-for-Profit Law, there are currently 51 bills under consideration in 24\nstate legislatures, including as many as 10 in #Oklahoma, that they warn would\nthreaten the right to assemble peacefully.\n\n\"Among the proposed laws are nine, including three in Oklahoma, that the\nTracker reports would provide civil and/or criminal immunity for drivers\ninjuring or killing protesters unlawfully disrupting traffic and one stand-\nyour-ground bill in #NewHampshire that would allow deadly force against\nprotesters 'likely' to use 'any' degree of unlawful force during a riot.\n\n\"Other bills would increase penalties for participating in unlawful protests,\nsomething that happens automatically in many jurisdictions once someone\nmarches without a permit, or for committing an offense ‚Äì including jaywalking\nor trespassing ‚Äì while in an unlawful assembly.\n\n\"International human rights law protects the right of peaceful assembly and\nrequires authorities at all levels to facilitate such assemblies and avoid\nunnecessary or disproportionate restrictions on them. The mere act of planning\nor participating in a protest should not be criminalized. Authorities are also\nrequired to protect people participating in such assemblies ‚Äì bills that\nencourage or allow violence against protesters are inconsistent with those\nobligations, and states should abandon them.\"\n\n\n\n#Fascism #ClimateAction #ClimateActivism #ACAB #WaterIsLife #Oligarchy\n\n",

The ensuing\nclashes arguably represent the culmination of that era‚Äôs powerful social\nmovements. In the following narrative, a participant in the events in Qu√©bec\nCity offers a blow-by-blow account of the epic street battles of April 20-21,\nincluding selections from the anarchist media coverage of that time.
