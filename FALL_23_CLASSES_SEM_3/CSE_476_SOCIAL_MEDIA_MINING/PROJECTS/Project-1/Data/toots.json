In #Minnesota, at least 66 felony theft\ncharges against #Line3 protesters remain open\n\nAlexandria Herr for Floodlight  \nThu 10 Feb 2022\n\n\"Last summer [2021] Sabine von Mering, a professor of German at Brandeis\nUniversity, drove more than 1,500 miles from Boston to Minneapolis to protest\nagainst the replacement of the Line 3 #OilPipeline that stretches from\n#Canada‚Äôs #TarSands down to Minnesota.\n\n\"Along with another protester, she locked herself to a semi-truck in the\nmiddle of a roadway, according to a filed court brief, as a means of #peaceful\n#resistance. But when she was arrested, she was charged with a serious crime:\nfelony theft, which carries up to five years in prison.\n\n\"'It‚Äôs very scary that they criminalize us like that, and to face jail time,'\nsaid Von Mering, 54, of her June arrest. 'But what can I do? I feel\nresponsible to my kids and #FutureGenerations.'\n\n\"The felony charges come as more than a dozen states have passed laws to\ncriminalize #FossilFuel protests, and as the federal government has ramped up\nits own tactics for surveilling and penalizing protesters.\n\n\"Von Mering is one of nearly 900 protesters who were arrested in Minnesota for\nprotesting against the pipeline‚Äôs construction, with the vast majority of\narrests taking place during the summer of 2021, and one of dozens facing\nfelony charges. Construction on the Line 3 pipeline was finalized in October\n2021 and carries 760,000 barrels of oil per day across northern Minnesota. But\nits construction for years has stoked fierce protests and legal challenges,\nled by #Indigenous activists in northern Minnesota who worried about potential\nimpacts of oil spills and the pipeline‚Äôs threat to #treaty rights to gather\nwild rice. While most of the arrests have led to misdemeanor or gross\nmisdemeanor charges for crimes including 'disturbing the peace' and\n'trespassing', felony charges like Von Mering‚Äôs mean protesters are facing\nyears of jail time.\n\n\"Legal advocates say that in Minnesota the elevated charges are a novel tactic\nto challenge protest actions against pipeline construction. They see them as\nfurthering evidence of close ties between Minnesota‚Äôs government and the\n#FossilFuelIndustry. It follows reporting by the Guardian that the Canadian\npipeline company #Enbridge, which is building Line 3, reimbursed Minnesota‚Äôs\n#police department $2.4m for time spent arresting protesters and on equipment\nincluding ballistic helmets. Experts say the reimbursement strategy for\narrests is a new technique in both Minnesota and across the US, and there‚Äôs\nconcern it can be replicated.\n\n\"'I do a lot of representation for people in political protests and I‚Äôve never\nseen anything like that,' said Jordan Kushner, a defense attorney representing\nclients charged in relation to Line 3 protests.\n\n\"Two of Kushner‚Äôs clients were charged with felony 'aiding attempted suicide'\ncharges for crawling inside a pipe. The charge is for someone who\n'intentionally advises, encourages, or assists another who attempts but fails\nto take the other‚Äôs own life', according to Minnesota law and carries up to a\nseven-year sentence. Authorities alleged that the protesters were endangering\ntheir lives by remaining inside the pipeline.\"\n\nRead more:  \n\nprotesters-line-3\n\n#StopEnbridge #NoLine3 #Protestors #ClimateActivists #Fascism #WaterIsLife\n#ACAB #IndigenousNews\n\n",
