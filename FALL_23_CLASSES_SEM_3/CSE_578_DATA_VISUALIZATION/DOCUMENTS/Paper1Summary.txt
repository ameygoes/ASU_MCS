- Textbooks during this time provided detailed descriptions of graphic methods, including frequency and cumulative frequency curves, smoothing of time-series graphs, and historical diagrams.
- Graphical methods were crucial in various scientific discoveries and theories, including astronomy, physics, and biology.
- The use of graphics in historical analysis was also explored, with the idea that historical events and statistical facts could be understood better through graphical representations.
- The Milestone Project collects historical information and analyzes trends over time using graphical methods.
- Trends in milestone development were examined based on place of development (Europe vs. North America), revealing interesting patterns.
- Classifying milestone items by subject and aspect provided insights into the types of innovations in different fields.
- Understanding historical graphs requires considering the available data, methods, technology, and the understanding of the time period.
- A re-analysis of historical graphs from a modern perspective can provide a better understanding of the intentions and messages behind the original graphs.

In summary, the Golden Age of statistical graphics saw significant advancements in visualization techniques, with a focus on displaying multiple variables and analyzing historical data. The Milestone Project uses graphical methods to analyze trends over time, and re-analyzing historical graphs can provide new insights into the intentions behind the original visualizations.

======================== BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ALL EPOCHS =============================
The historical epochs of data visualization can be summarized as follows:

1. Pre-17th Century: Early maps and diagrams - This epoch focuses on the earliest forms of visualization, such as geometric diagrams, celestial maps, and navigation charts.

2. 17th Century: Measurement and Theory - During this period, there was a growing emphasis on measurement and the development of mathematical theories. This led to advancements in graphical representations of data.

3. 18th Century: New graphic forms - The 18th century saw the emergence of new graphic forms, including bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts. These visualizations were used to represent statistical data and communicate information effectively.

4. 19th Century: Begin modern period - The 19th century marked the beginning of the modern period of data visualization. It was characterized by advancements in technology, such as the invention of the printing press and the development of statistical graphics.

5. 20th Century: Golden age - This epoch is considered the golden age of data visualization. It saw significant advancements in graphical techniques, including the use of color, animation, and interactive elements. Many iconic visualizations, such as Minard's map of Napoleon's Russian campaign, were created during this period.

6. 20th Century: Modern dark ages - The modern dark ages refer to a period of decline in data visualization during the mid-20th century. This was due to various factors, including the dominance of statistical tables and the limited availability of graphical tools.

7. 20th Century: Re-birth - The re-birth epoch marks a resurgence of interest in data visualization. With the advent of computers and digital technology, new possibilities for visualizing data emerged. This period saw the development of interactive graphics and the integration of visualization into various fields, such as statistics, computer science, and design.

8. 21st Century: High-D Vis - The current epoch is characterized by the exploration of high-dimensional data visualization. With the increasing complexity and volume of data, researchers and practitioners are developing innovative techniques to visualize and analyze large datasets.

These epochs provide a framework for understanding the historical development of data visualization and the key milestones that have shaped the field.

========================= ANSWER FOR QUESTION PROF ASKED ========================
In Michael Friendly's "A Brief History of Data Visualization," he outlines several historical epochs of data visualization. Two of these epochs are the Pre-17th Century: Early maps and diagrams and the 1975-present: High-D, interactive and dynamic data visualization.

The Pre-17th Century epoch focuses on the earliest seeds of visualization, which arose in geometric diagrams, tables of celestial bodies' positions, and the making of maps for navigation and exploration. During this period, visualization techniques were primarily used in cartography and astronomy. These early maps and diagrams laid the foundation for future developments in data visualization by introducing the concept of representing quantitative information visually.

On the other hand, the 1975-present epoch marks a significant shift in data visualization with the advent of highly interactive and dynamic visualization techniques. This period saw the development of command-driven, programmable systems, which allowed users to directly manipulate and analyze visual data. New methods for visualizing high-dimensional data also emerged during this time, such as the grand tour, scatterplot matrix, and parallel coordinates plot. These advancements in interactive and dynamic data visualization have greatly enhanced the ability to explore and understand complex datasets.

Overall, these two epochs highlight the evolution of data visualization from its early beginnings in maps and diagrams to the modern era of interactive and dynamic visualizations. They demonstrate how visualization techniques have evolved over time to meet the growing needs of data analysis and exploration.
